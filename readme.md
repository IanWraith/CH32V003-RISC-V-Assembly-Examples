## RISC-V Assembly Language Examples

### Why
Having bought a cheap and cheerful CH32V003 development board on AliExpress I wanted to learn RISC-V assembly language.
Previously I have worked with the 6502 , Z80 , 8051 (showing my age there) as well as doing some x86 and ARM assembly
but I wanted to learn something new. While there are loads of generic RISC-V assembly tutorials out there I found
very little specific to the CH32V003 so I thought I should put my code online to assist anyone else in the same 
position as me.

### Thanks
None of this would have been possible without the excellent work by ..

Firstly [cnlohr](https://github.com/cnlohr/ch32v003fun) without who none of this would have been possible.

Also [Piotr Zapart](https://gist.github.com/hexeguitar) who did all the hard work with I2C as the CH32V003 
reference manual doesn't offer a lot of help.
